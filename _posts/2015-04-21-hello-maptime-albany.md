Join us for the first Maptime Albany meetup!

> "Maptime is an open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge, offering intentional educational support for the beginner."

[http://maptime.io/about/](http://maptime.io/about/)

We'll kick-off by learning what Maptime is all about and the future of our meetings - are you interested in leading a tutorial? Group activity? Giving a presentation? Maptime is great place to learn and practice your skills.

The theme this week: *What are you working on?*

We'll have demos from Spatial Networks, Avail labs, and Mapbox to showcase some of the geo projects people are working on in our area. Want to share your latest project?

We'll leave the floor open.

**We'll be meeting at the University at Albany - room AS 123.**
